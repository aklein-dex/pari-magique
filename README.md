Rails Web site for users to predict the result of soccer games.

#### Background

I had this idea in 2008. With a small group of friends we decided to predict the result of games during major competitions (Euro and World Cup). I was using a static html page. Users were sending me their guesses by email and I modified the html page manually. It was a lot of work.
In 2012, more friends joined and it would have been to much work to do everything manually so I created a more dynamic PHP Web site (using [Yii framework](www.yiiframework.com/)) where people could log in and enter their guesses. 
In 2017, I decided to switch to Rails because it is my favorite Web framework and I could add more features.

The goal is to use github with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for easy deployment.
